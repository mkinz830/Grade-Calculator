# ðŸ§® Grade Calculator

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This is a simple Python function that calculates a letter grade based on a numeric score input. It's designed to demonstrate basic use of functions, conditional logic, and input validation.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
The `computegrade()` function takes a score between 0.0 and 1.0 and returns a letter grade (Aâ€“F) based on standard grading criteria.

## ðŸ”¤ Grading Scale
- 0.9 and above â†’ A  
- 0.8 to < 0.9 â†’ B  
- 0.7 to < 0.8 â†’ C  
- 0.6 to < 0.7 â†’ D  
- Below 0.6 â†’ F  

If the score is out of range or not a number, it returns `"Error"`.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Python file in your editor or run it in a Python environment.
3. Call `computegrade(score)` where `score` is a float between 0.0 and 1.0.

Example:
```python
computegrade(0.85)  # Output: B
